# CCT_for_JPEG
### Discription 
Color Coordinate Tunning (CCT) algorithm was a new approach proposed by VC Lab, Seoul, South Korea, in order to improve the quality and compression of the resulted image. In CCT, we maximize the variance of Luminance (Y) component of the image by rotating with a best-fit angle.
